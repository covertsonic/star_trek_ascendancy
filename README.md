# Star Trek Ascendancy Apps
This project is to streamline the board game, [Star Trek Ascendancy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/193949/star-trek-ascendancy), for activities that could be helped with a pretty calculator.

|App| Brief  | Why | 
|--|--|--|
|Combat Dice Calculator  | Automated die rolling based on weapon and shield technology.*  | During the late game, combat rolls can take up to 10 minutes.**|
|Turn Order Randomizer | Quickly create turn orders. |Handing out turn order cards takes an unnecessary 2 minutes per round, and turn order cards are often misplaced. |

 **Edge cases are not directly supported such as  first strike, “always hit on 5’s & 6’s”, starbases, and re-rolls; the app will allow you to manually edit the surviving ships at the end of each round so players can handle the nuances after the main rolls have completed.*
 
***Combat slows down, especially in the Dominion War variant, when fleets of 20 vs 20 ships fight and each side has low die probabilities-to-hit and many special effects to modify rolls. This is especially challenging in games of 6 players where 4 players are stuck in spectator mode.*
