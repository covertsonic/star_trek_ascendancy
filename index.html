      <p> <em>*Edge cases are not directly supported such as first strike, “always hit on 5’s &amp; 6’s”, starbases, and re-rolls; the app will allow you to manually edit the surviving ships at the end of each round so players can handle the nuances after the main rolls have completed.</em></p>
      <p><em>**Combat slows down, especially in the Dominion War variant, when fleets of 20 vs 20 ships fight and each side has low die probabilities-to-hit and many special effects to modify rolls. This is especially challenging in games of 6 players where 4 players are stuck in spectator mode.</em></p>
